# Weather-Forecasting-Using-R

The following project works on weather forecasting by the use of R Programming language. The project first analyses the dataset in the past and then predicts the weather. It produced forecasts such as
* Forecasts Using Holt-Winters Additive Method
* Forecasts till 2025 of monthly high temprature
* Forecasts till 2080 of monthly high temprature
